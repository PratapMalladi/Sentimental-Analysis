#Sentimental-Analysis

Sentiment analysis of any topic by parsing the tweets fetched from Twitter using Python.

What is sentiment analysis?

Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.

Why sentiment analysis?
 
Business: In marketing field companies use it to develop their strategies, to understand customers’ feelings towards products or brand, how people respond to their campaigns or product launches and why consumers don’t buy some
products.

Politics: In political field, it is used to keep track of political view, to detect consistency and inconsistency between statements and actions at the government level. It can be used to predict election results as well!

Public Actions: Sentiment analysis also is used to monitor and analyse social phenomena, for the spotting of potentially dangerous situations and determining the general mood of the blogosphere.

Sentiment analysis can be used to:

Analyze tweets and/or Facebook posts over a period of time to detect the sentiment of a particular audience. Monitor social media mentions of your brand and automatically categorize it by urgency. Automatically route social media mentions to team members best fit to respond.

##Code Can't be disclosed as part of the legalities involoved, only very high level presentation is shared and available research papers on the Business problem context because I feel working in data science and machine learning is an exciting and challenging field. New techniques and tools are constantly percolating and honestly, it can feel overwhelming. Many of these new developments are found and first revealed in academic research articles. Extracting knowledge from these articles is difficult because the intended audience of these papers tend to be other researchers. Yet in order to stay current reading papers is an essential skill — luckily one that can be improved with diligence and practice.
